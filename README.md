In essence, most image processing software (e.g., ImageJ) includes a Brightness/Contrast feature. However, the slider range is typically predefined based on the image's bit depth. For images with high bit depth, identifying low-intensity features necessitates minutely adjusting the mouse pointer near the slider's lower boundary. Even a slight movement of the slider can result in a significant change, making precise adjustments in the low-intensity area challenging.

This straightforward app is designed for detecting low-intensity features in TIFF images with high bit depth (e.g., 32-bit), a common scenario in small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments. It loads a grayscale TIFF image and offers a slider for fine-tuning the display's lower and upper intensity limits. The slider's upper limit adjusts automatically, facilitating precise control in areas of low light intensity.

The UI is intuitive. Maximizing the window can further extend the slider.
